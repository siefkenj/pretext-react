<div class="para">Similarly, within a paragraph, you can identify edits between versions as <ins class="insert">inserted text that has been added</ins> with <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">&lt;insert&gt;</code> or as <del class="delete">deleted text that has been removed</del> with <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">&lt;delete&gt;</code>.  Note that these identified edits are slightly different than <s class="stale">stale text that you want to retain, but which is no longer relevant</s>, which is accomplished with <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">&lt;stale&gt;</code>.  The original request for stale text came from an instructor with an online list of student topics for presentations, and as students claimed topics they were marked as no longer available for other students.</div>
