<div class="para">A “description” list  has a short term or phrase that is prominent, followed by a short description.  It is modeled on the lists of similar structure in both <span class="latex-logo">L<span class="A">a</span>T<span class="E">e</span>X</span> and HTML.  It makes for a nice medium-weight way to define terms, somewhere in-between the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">term</code> tag which just makes a term prominent in a sentence, and a <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">definition</code>, which is set off, has a heading, a number, and a title.  Do not try to manage the separation between the title and the description by employing punctuation (but you can include a question-mark or exclamation-point if necessary).  For example, do not include a colon to the end of the title.  This example is from Bob Plantz.</div>
