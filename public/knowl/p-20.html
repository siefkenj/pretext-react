<p>This text is intended for a one or two-semester undergraduate course in  abstract algebra. Traditionally, these courses have covered the theoretical aspects of groups, rings, and fields.  However, with the development of computing in the last several decades, applications that involve abstract algebra and discrete mathematics have become increasingly important, and many science, engineering, and computer science students are now electing to minor in mathematics. Though theory still occupies a central role in the subject of abstract algebra and no student should go through such a course without a good notion of what a proof is, the importance of applications such as coding theory and cryptography has grown significantly.</p>
